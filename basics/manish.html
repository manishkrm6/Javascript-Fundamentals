              Hi! My name is Manish Kumar and I'm a Software Developer
              at Indovision working since July-2017 till present.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love writing codes for web development in PHP, JavaScript, Ajax, Codeigniter. You can see my list of Projects done in php
              <a href="https://github.com/manishkrm6"
                >all my done Projects</a
              >
              but also on my
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/academind">YouTube channel.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm extremely excited to have an opportunity in PHP Projects  :-)

          <h4>SAP Analysis Tool for EY</h4>
          <p>
            EY SAP Analysis Tool
            <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_in">inputs client's SAP </a>
            and
            <a href="info/weakly-typed.html">weakly typed</a>
            programming language which was built with the purpose of running in
            host environments (e.g. inside of a webpage in the browser).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web as it's the
            only "thing" in web development that allows you (= the developer) to
            change something on the page at runtime. Basically everytime
            something opens, closes, moves or changes on a webpage, JavaScript
            will be involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            There also a lot of webpages which are almost entirely powered by
            JavaScript (i.e. where a lot of the rendering work happens in the
            browser) - those pages typically use frameworks like Angular, but
            that's a topic we'll cover later in the course. :-)

          <h2>What will you learn in this Course?</h2>
